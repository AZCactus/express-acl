You want the admin to have all the access on resources.\n\n\nsolution:\n\n\nadmin:\n  resource: all\n  methods: all\n  action: allow\n\nuser:\n  resource: users\n  methods:\n    - DELETE\n  action: deny\n\n  resource: blogs\n  methods:\n    - GET\n  action: allow\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation\n\n\nThe admin group has access to all resource and can perform all operation on any resource. Therefore, we need to allow all resources and methods. However, the user group is allowed to only read the blogs, create, read and update their own user profiles.\n\n\nYou may ask, why did we apply deny action on DELETE method instead of allowing other HTTP methods? In express-acl when you allow one method, you automatically deny access to the other methods and when you deny one you allow the remaining methods.\n\n\nThus denying one method is faster than allowing three or four methods. When it comes to blogs we only need them to read therefore we allow GET methods which means the other methods are denied.\n\n\nFor you to formulate good ACL rules, you need to understand the princple of negation. To allow is to deny and to deny is to allow, confusing right? how can you deny and allow at the same time?. Lets look at this example, if I have 4 methods POST, GET, PUT, DELETE and I deny POST. This is same as saying allow GET,PUT,DELETE and if I allow POST is same as saying deny GET,PUT,DELETE.\n\n\nNow that we have established that lets write our config file.

This enables us to group users using roles and define policies through groups insted of doing it per user.

Therefore if you have a role associated to users, ensure that such role has been defined in your rules configurations.\n\n\n{\n  \nstatus\n: \nAccess Denied\n,\n  \nsuccess\n: false,\n  \nmessage\n:\nREQUIRED: Role not found\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThis error will also return a status of \n404\n.\n\n\nUnauthorized access.\n\n\nWhen a user is trying to access a resource that they are not allowed access to, Express acl will deny access to that a resource and send status of \n403\n with JSON response as follows.\n\n\n{\n  \nstatus\n: \nAccess Denied\n,\n  \nsuccess\n: false,\n  \nmessage\n:\nUnauthorized access\n\n}",
